	<h2>Project information</h2>
	<p>In this day and age climate change and energy consumption is of
		big importance. So naturally people start to look at things they can
		change in their own environments to affect the climate in a good way.
		But as much as people want to sacrifice for a good case they also want
		to keep to their benefits, which in our case is human comfort in form
		of proper temperature, humidity and pressure. It is possible to save a
		lot of energy by turning all comforting tools (ventilation etc.) off,
		but this will result in poor human comfort. So the objective for this
		project is to provide a compromise between saving energy and providing
		human comfort. We intend to do this by providing the actuators with
		enough information to make good choices.</p>
