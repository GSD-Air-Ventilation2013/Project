Pre-requisites for running the code:
- JDK (Java Development Kit) can be acquired here: http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html
- Eclipse Juno 4.2 can be acquired here: http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html

When the pre-requisites have been downloaded and installed please follow these steps:
- Open Eclipse.
- Right click in the Package Explorer view and choose "Import Project".
- Choose "General" -> "Existing Projects into Workspace"
- Locate the "AirVentilation" folder
- Press "Finish"

Now the AirVentilation project should appear in the Package Explorer.
To launch the application, a local Apache Tomcat Server needs to be installed.
Please follow these steps:
- Right click on the "Air Ventilation" project in the Package Explorer.
- Choose "Run As" -> "Run on Server"

Now it might prompt you for what server you want to run the application on.
- Choose "Apache" -> "Tomcat v7.0 Server"
- Press "Next"

If you dont have the above server installed, you need to download and install it.
This can be done from the "Run As" Wizard.

- Pres the "Download and install" link in the window.
- Choose the download path.
- After a while, manually choose the path and set it to the download path.
- Press Finish

Eclipse will open the application in a built-in browser. We recommend copying the URL and using it in a mainstream browser 
like Google Chrome or Firefox.
